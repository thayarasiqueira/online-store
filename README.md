# Online Store

This project creates a simplified version, without database persistence, of an online store, developing in group its functionalities according to demands defined in a Kanban framework. From these demands, we will have an application where users will be able to

- Search for products by terms and categories from the Mercado Livre API;
- Interact with the searched products in order to add and remove them from a shopping cart in different quantities;
- View details and previous reviews of a product, as well as create new reviews;
- And finally, finalize the (simulated) purchase of the selected items.

The layout is focused on desktop devices, so all prototypes were developed for bigger screens.

The group organized itself through the Kanban method, using Trello to allow all team members visualizing and changing each state of each demmand.
